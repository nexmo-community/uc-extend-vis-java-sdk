# uc-extend-vis-java-sdk

This is an example of using swagger-codegen to generate a Java SDK for the UC Extend VIS (Vonage Integration Suite) APIs. You may
register for a developer account at https://developer.vonage.com/store and subscribe to this API. Generating an SDK is not necessary
to use the VIS APIs: developers often prefer to make the REST calls themselves, however others find using an SDK is more convenient.

Developers are encouraged to modify the swagger-codegen options in the `pom.xml` as they see fit. For more information about possible
configuration options, see: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/master/modules/swagger-codegen-maven-plugin.
